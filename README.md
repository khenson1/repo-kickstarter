## RESULTS

- WHAT ARE TWO CONCLUSIONS YOU CAN DRAW ABOUT THE OUTCOMES BASED ON LAUNCH DATE?
Comparing the difference between the goal and the actual amount pledged, successfull campaigns had roughly the same amount with $5300, while unsuccessful campaigns' goal was around $10,000 and the pledged amount only averaged $560. The best time to start a kickstater would in either May or June, and to have a goal amount around $4500.
